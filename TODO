    - all steps on failure are not repreated in the same order
        need to have assertion and repeatable steps for all files in .ssh/
    - config is content is dependand on current user
        which is not reflected in current config
    - name of keys should match the ssh/config values
    - create empty keys files
    - add ssh/config to github(not the keys)
